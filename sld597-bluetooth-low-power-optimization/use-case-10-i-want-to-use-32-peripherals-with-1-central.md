# Use Case #10: I want to exchange data with up to 32 peripheral devices

This use case describes an EFR32 central that scales to 32 simultaneous EFR32 peripheral links. It provides a characterization baseline for a Bluetooth Low Energy central that scans for peripherals advertising a known custom service, opens links as peers are found, discovers the required GATT objects, enables notifications, and maintains up to 32 simultaneous connections with selectable PHY operation. For information about the general requirements for handling multiple connections, see [Multi-Peripheral Topology](https://docs.silabs.com/bluetooth/latest/bluetooth-fundamentals-connections/multi-peripheral-topology).

The reference topology consists of one central and up to 32 peripheral connections. The software baseline is SiSDK 2025.12.3. The hardware baseline is an EFR32MG26 on a BRD4116A radio board with a BRD4002A mainboard.

**Bluetooth features used**: connections, legacy passive scanning, GATT service discovery, notifications, optional write-without-response traffic, and selectable 1M, 2M, or Coded PHY operation.

## System Model and Assumptions

### Topology

- One EFR32 central maintains N simultaneous connections, where N can scale up to 32.
- The central uses a fixed-size peer table sized for the target connection count and treats each discovered peripheral as a managed slot in that table.
- All links are intended to remain active once opened. Application does not deliberately disconnect.
- Baseline runtime behavior is continuous multi-link management, GATT service discovery, notification reception from peripherals, and automatic reconnect handling after disconnects.
- Scanning restarts after connection events and during maintenance so discovery and reconnection can continue while other connections are active.

### Baseline Connection Configurations

- ATT MTU = 247.
- 1M PHY on all links.
- Peripheral latency = 0.
- Connection interval = 50 ms.
- No Bluetooth security used.
- Supervision timeout = 6000 ms.
- DLE enabled, preferred data length = 251.
- Even Connection Scheduling Algorithm enabled.
- Use legacy passive scanning to discover peripherals that advertise the custom 128-bit service UUID in the advertising payload.
- The central expects the peripheral GATT database to expose one custom service containing a notify characteristic for peripheral-to-central data and a write-without-response characteristic for optional central-to-peripheral traffic.
- For the additional application features used, see [Appendix A. Application features](#appendix-a-application-features).


### General Configuration Tips

- Choose the right PHY profile: 1M, 2M, or Coded, based on throughput, airtime, and range requirements. More information on the trade-offs between PHYs can be found [here](https://docs.silabs.com/bluetooth/latest/bluetooth-fundamentals-connections/coded-phy).
- Size the connection budget for 8, 16, 20, 24, or 32 maintained links and set connection parameters and stack memory accordingly.
- Tune minimum and maximum connection event length to control scheduler margin.
- Align data length, ATT MTU, and available buffering with the intended traffic profile. Generic throughput optimization techniques are available [here](https://docs.silabs.com/bluetooth/latest/bluetooth-fundamentals-connections/multi-peripheral-topology).
- An appropriate Bluetooth security mechanism may be implemented using [Security Manager](https://docs.silabs.com/bluetooth/latest/bluetooth-stack-api/sl-bt-sm).
- For cases where 2.4 GHz congestion is expected, such as with coexistence, the following mitigations can be helpful:
    - Use longer connection intervals.
    - Reduce payload size.
    - Use [AFH](https://docs.silabs.com/bluetooth/latest/bluetooth-fundamentals-system-performance/afh).
    - Use [Channel Classification](https://docs.silabs.com/bluetooth/latest/bluetooth-fundamentals-system-performance/le-channel-classification).
    - Switch to a more robust PHY.

### Test Conditions

- Use peripherals that expose the required custom service and characteristic contract expected by the central.
- The test passes if all target links stay connected for the full test duration with no unexpected disconnects.
- Use good RF conditions, low external interference, fixed node placement, and identical peripheral firmware/configuration.

## Failure Modes and Mitigations

| Failure Mode | Typical Trigger | What to Watch | Likely Outcome | First Mitigation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Event overlap | Short intervals, long events, many active links | Link bring-up stability, scheduler margin | Delayed service | Increase interval or reduce CE length |
| Missed events | High load, RF retries, or aggressive traffic settings | Disconnect count, supervision margin | Link instability | Lower duty cycle or payload size |
| Rising retransmissions | RF congestion or weak links | Retry rate, throughput drop | Reduced throughput | Improve RF conditions or use longer intervals |
| Timeout risk | Repeated missed service windows | Disconnect reasons, supervision timeout | Disconnects | Increase interval margin and reduce link load |
| Reconnect churn | Intermittent peripherals or marginal RF conditions | Reconnect attempts and dwell-time drops | Link flapping | Implement reconnection backoff |

## Decision Tree: When to Choose PAwR Instead of Many Connections

Use this quick check:

| If your design needs... | Prefer... |
| --- | --- |
| Per-node connection state, GATT discovery, notifications, writes, or low-latency two-way exchange for each device | Many connections |
| Mostly synchronized broadcast data, with optional scheduled responses from many devices | PAwR |
| More devices than the connection scheduler can comfortably maintain, or reconnect churn is the main bottleneck | PAwR, if the application can avoid always-on per-node links |

If both rows apply, start with many connections for up to 32 managed links and evaluate PAwR only if scheduler margin, reconnection behavior, or scaling becomes the limiting factor.
