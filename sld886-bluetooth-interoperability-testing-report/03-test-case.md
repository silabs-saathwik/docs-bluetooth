# Test Case

The table below provides the details of the test cases. All the test cases were executed using the setup described in [Test Environment](./02-test-environment.md) with multiple phones. The test cases are designed to test interoperability between the mobile phones and Bluetooth Mesh implementation of Silicon Labs only and not for other categories of testing. All the below tests were run sequentially without breaks.
